# Pre-commit Hooks Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to pass pre-commit hooks.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Trailing Whitespace
Fixed trailing whitespace in the following files:
- `pytest.ini`
- `PHASE1_SUMMARY.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`
- `TESTING.md`
- `README_TESTING.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### 2. Missing End-of-File Newlines
Added missing newlines at the end of these files:
- `requirements-dev.txt`
- `PHASE_1_3_SUMMARY.md`
- `ofm/res/names.json`
- `pytest.ini`
- `CI_CD_SETUP.md`
- `mypy.ini`
- `requirements.txt`
- `docs/readme.rst`
- `Makefile`
- `ofm/res/clubs_def.json`
- `ofm/res/license_names.json.md`
- `docs/TRANSFER_SYSTEM.md`
- `scripts/setup_testing.sh`

### 3. Mixed Line Endings
Fixed mixed line endings (all files now use consistent line endings).

### 4. Code Formatting (Black)
Reformatted 57 Python files to comply with Black formatting standards:
- Consistent indentation and spacing
- Proper line length management
- Standardized quote usage

### 5. Import Sorting (isort)
Fixed import ordering in multiple files following the Black profile:
- Grouped imports by type (standard library, third-party, local)
- Alphabetical ordering within groups
- Proper spacing between import groups

### 6. Linting Issues (flake8)
Fixed the following types of issues:
- **Unused imports**: Removed unused imports in multiple files
- **Undefined names**: Added missing imports for `Transfer` and `TransferOffer` in test files
- **Line length**: Split long lines to stay within 100 character limit
- **Bare except**: Changed bare `except:` to `except Exception:`
- **Unused variables**: Removed or properly marked variables that were assigned but never used

### Key Files Modified

1. **Test Files**:
   - `ofm/tests/test_transfer_system.py`: Added missing imports for Transfer models
   - `test_gui.py`: Marked test imports as used with `del` statements
   
2. **Demo Files**:
   - `demo_features.py`: Fixed imports, line lengths, and bare except
   - `demo_transfer_system.py`: Removed unused imports
   - `simple_gui_demo.py`: Fixed imports and line lengths

3. **Core Modules**:
   - `ofm/core/db/generators.py`: Removed unused import, fixed docstring line length
   - `ofm/core/db/models/*.py`: Fixed various import and line length issues

## Pre-commit Configuration

All fixes ensure compliance with the project's pre-commit configuration:
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting with Black-compatible profile
- **flake8**: Linting with 100-character line length limit
- **Trailing whitespace**: Automatic removal
- **End-of-file fixer**: Ensures files end with newline
- **Mixed line ending**: Consistent line endings across all files

## Running Pre-commit

To verify all fixes are working:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

All hooks should now pass successfully.
