#### Technical Implementation

```python
# Example League Model
class League(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'leagues'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    country = Column(String(3), nullable=False)  # ISO code
    level = Column(Integer, nullable=False)  # 1 = top division
    num_teams = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    promotion_places = Column(Integer, default=0)
    relegation_places = Column(Integer, default=0)

    # Relationships
    teams = relationship("TeamSeason", back_populates="league")
    fixtures = relationship("Fixture", back_populates="league")
```

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Competitions table
CREATE TABLE competitions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    type ENUM('league', 'cup', 'tournament'),
    country VARCHAR(3),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
);

## Agent Orchestration Plan

### Phase 1 Orchestration
```yaml
season_structure:
  lead_agents: [backend-nodejs-ecosystem, backend-database-architecture]
  support: [analysis-business, frontend-nextjs-ecosystem]
  pattern: sequential_with_validation

save_load_system:
  lead_agents: [backend-nodejs-ecosystem]
  support: [backend-database-architecture, devops-infrastructure-security]
