# OPENFOOT MANAGER PROJECT

**OpenFoot Manager** (temporary name) is a free and open source football/soccer manager game, licensed under the [GPLv3](LICENSE.md), inspired by the famous franchise Football Manager&trade;, and based on the source code of [Bygfoot](https://bygfoot.sourceforge.io/new/), an abandoned manager game.

The purpose of this project is to provide an interesting and fun game for simulating a manager's life in a simple way: managing a team, dealing with players, finances and many other features. Resembling the gameplay of Football Manager, FIFA Manager, Championship Manager, Elifoot, Bygfoot, Brasfoot etc. this game aims to become a complete alternative for these games.

## INSTALLATION

The game is still under development and it is not even close to ready for gameplay action. However, we already have a debug version of the game for testing purposes.

To run the debug build, ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher. This project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage virtual environments, and you can install it with the following command:

```
pip install pipenv
```

After cloning the repository, install the virtualenv and its dependencies using:

```
pipenv install
```

For contributors, you might also need development dependencies (black, isort, flake8, pytest, pre-commit):

```
pipenv install --dev
```

If you want to commit to the repo, install pre-commit:

```
pipenv run python -m pre-commit install
```

To run the tests:

```

```

To run the debug version of the project, use the `run.py` file at the root of this project folder:
